<!--------------BLOCK-LEVEL ELEMENTS----------------

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
-------->

<H2>Block-level Elements</H2>
<p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

<!---------------------INLINE ELEMENTS---------
    
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

<H2>Inline Elements</H2>
<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
